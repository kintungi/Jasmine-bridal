          <h4>Our commitment</h4>
          <p className='mt-32'>
            We are committed to creating unforgettable 
            experiences for our clients and everyone of 
            their guests from the entire wedding planning 
            process until the last guest to leave. We believe 
            that every successful event requires excellent 
            communication skills and thorough preparation 
            and that behind unforgettable experiences are 
            attention to detail, the ability to think outside 
            the box and the willingness to go above and beyond 
            the clientâ€™s expectations.
            </p>

           <p>We feel strongly responsible for the planet and its living creatures. In 2018, we have changed the way that we live at home and work, both in the office and on site, in order to minimize waste and to help animals to live a better life. We no longer offer balloons, floating lanterns or elephants. Our regular social services include public beach garbage pick up, visiting stray dog shelters, visiting young kids and educate them about the importance of the ocean.</p>
